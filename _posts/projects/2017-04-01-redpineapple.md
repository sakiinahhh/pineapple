<p>The project is an initiative to revitalize a multicultural shopping street in Rotterdam, called Middellandstraat. The design question was how to support the shops to attract more visitors to the shopping street through the food diversity. Investigations into the visitors' experience in the street, the context, and market research were done to define opportunities for the design development. The final design aims to enable people to be inspired and informed about the shop's authentic identity and historical value, make visitors feel comfortable in the shops to allow them to explore the Middellandstraat.
